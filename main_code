''' Vest Tracker
Sean Gunther
October 14, 2022


- In theory, this software identifies the centroid of the vest, but currently it thinks that everything not masked is the vest
- very important to reduce the resolution of the capture from the raspicam
- next steps are to build a housing and integrate motors
- the calculations for dx and dy are not accurate, it sometimes disregards negative numbers.
